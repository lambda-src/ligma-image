# Ligma Image Format

## What is ligma?

Ligma is one of the first ever human readable and writable image formats that is supported in several languages!
It follows the philosphy that images should be simple and easy to write and read, that's why every pixel in a ligma image is just the name of the color!
Yup that's it, just type up the image you want in a valid square or rectangle and you're golden!

## How do I use ligma?

Simply clone this repo and whatever you need for raylib to work then use `cargo run <Path to ligma file>`

Currently ligma can only use red green blue and yellow pixels too

Example of a 3x3 red square
```ligma
red red red
red red red
red red red

If typing red too many times gets annoying using any of the supported languages colors works too

Another valid 3x3 red square
```ligma
röt أحمر แดง
red rouge rosso 
красен 赤 rdeča
```
